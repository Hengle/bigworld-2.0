BigWorld contains a mozilla and llmozlib redistribution.

Based on this software license we need to specify what changes were done to these libraries and when

Changes were done on the period between 12/01/2009-23/01/2009

1. No change were done to the mozilla source code except for what is required based on the llmozlib compilation instructions. see http://svn.secondlife.com/trac/llmozlib/browser/trunk/llmozlib2/README-win32.txt
The patch file is also redistributed here just in case, see linden.patch in fantasydemo/game/mozilla
2. No changes were done to the llmozlib source code except for:
	a. Fixing the ubrowser to compile as ascii (this is not redistributed with our client exe but is provided here just in case)
	b. creating a dll wrapper using llmozlib (no source changes to the original files), but still the new files are attached:
		llmozlib_virtual_wrapper.h
		llmozlib_virtual_wrapper.cpp
		llmozlib_dll.h
		llmozlib_dll.cpp
