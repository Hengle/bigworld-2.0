This file describes the changes made to Python by MicroForte. The source was
originally downloaded from http://www.python.org/download as Python-2.4.tgz.

11th September 2003
builtin.dir can now handle any sequence for __members__ and __methods__, not
just PyList.

29th September 2003
typeobject.c looks in tp_dict for __module__ and __name__ for all type
objects, not just ones with the heap flag set.

3rd October 2003
Added low-level memory allocator redirection (low_level_malloc + friends)

15th December 2003
Added an interface to provide a different filename namespace.
This consists of the extern-able calls PyOS_fopen, PyOS_statType,
PyOS_listdir and PyOS_dlopen.  They are declared in pythonrun.h with
other PyOS stuff. They allow another filesystem to be inserted
underneath Python.

16th January 2004
ALTSEP is defined to be equal to SEP if not otherwise defined
(simplifies some code)

11th May 2004
In the generic getattr, now checking if tp_mro is set instead of always
assuming it is if tp_dict is set. Builtin types like descriptors seem
to not have this set.

18th September 2006
Integrated changes into Python 2.5. Some of our modifications were not
integrated:
- math, struct, time, _weakref, cString, cPickle are no longer compiled into
libpython2.5.a. Modules will now be shipped as .so files.
- ALTSEP is no longer always defined. Changed our code to handle this case.
- Low-level memory redirection has been removed.
- os.tempnam() and os.tmpnam() no longer returns an error when BigWorld's
file system is used. Instead, they are no longer built into the os module.
- PyObject_GenericGetAttr() no longer checks if tp->tp_mro is set.
- Compiler define PYTHONPATH is no longer set to "" on Windows.


23rd September 2008
Changed the following function prototypes to support the appropriate const 
semantics:
PyObject_CallFunction
PyObject_CallMethod
_PyObject_CallFunction_SizeT
_PyObject_CallMethod_SizeT
PySys_GetObject
PySys_SetObject
PySys_GetFile
PySys_SetPath

I also added a dodgy addendum to pyconfig.h generated from a diff between
a 32 bit and 64 bit output of the configuration script to make the ultimate 
state effectively the same as if the appropriate header had been used. If
python is reconfigured, this needs to be manually generated and added to the 
end.



To buld the dynamically loadable modules (.so):

 NOTE: BigWorld has performed a large number of modifications to the
       Python Makefile. This makefile should be used where possible and
       not regenerated unless absolutely necessary. However if you have
       a need to rebuild the Makefile for any reason, you will need to
       make a backup of the BigWorld modifications, run the configure
       script, and then merge the BigWorld modifications back into the
       newly generated Makefile.

       When using the configure script, you will need to specify the
       following option, along with any other options your build may
       require:

       $ ./configure --enable-unicode=ucs4


Assumptions and Requirements)
 To successfully build the .so files you will need a working build environment
 which should normally already be enabled for building the libraries / server
 components.

 In addition you may need to install a number of packages onto your
 distribution corresponding to modules that are provided by Python. On CentOS
 the following packages should be installed in order to build most of the
 required modules

 $ yum install bzip2-devel
 $ yum install libdbi-devel
 $ yum install ncurses-devel
 $ yum install sqlite-devel


Step 1) Building the Python interpreter

 In order to build the interpreter, some rules must be modified in the
 Makefile. 

 1.1) Open src/lib/python/Makefile
 1.2) Uncomment the line:

   BW_STANDARD_PYTHON = 1

  1.3) It is recommended that you do make clean if you have already done a
server build.

   $ cd src/lib/python
   $ make clean

 1.4) Build the interpreter. In src/lib/python type:

   $ make


Step 2)  Build the python modules. In src/lib/python type:

   $ make sharedmods

  The modules will be built into a location such as
  src/lib/python/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6.

  The contents of this directory can then be copied (if required) into
  bigworld/res/scripts/common/lib-dynload<architecture>


Step 3) Cleanup modifications.

  You will now want to revert the changes you have made to the Python
  Makefile so that when you perform a regular build the options
  specific to this procedure aren't used.

  Eg:
  $ svn revert src/lib/python/Makefile

  It is also good practice to clean out all of the build files that have
  been generated as part of this process.

  $ cd src/lib/python
  $ make clean
